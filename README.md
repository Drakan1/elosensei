# Elo-sensei

A Discord bot implementing the Elo rating system for arbitrary games.

Elo-sensei is written in Python and is specifically designed for ranked
MissileWars on CubeKrowd, but should also be able to accommodate other
games.

## Dependencies
* Python >= 3.5
* Discord.py >= 1.0.0
* pandas

## License
Because a decent chunk of the code is derived from Blank's sudoBot,
which is licensed under the GNU GPL v3, Elo-sensei is also licensed
under the GNU GPL v3.

## Thanks
* CubeKrowd's staff and players for hosting and maintaining
the wonderful community that makes this possible
* Ausxh/Kurusa for this idea
* XNBlank for providing a great example of a simple, working discord bot
* Rapptz and Discord for providing the platform to make this possible
